One Question Quiz
Create a one question quiz that validates itself and checks the user input against the correct answer. Eg. pizza validates true when typed in an input
Football Team Organiser
Using the data set provided, build a component to allow users to select players from the list and create their ideal Borussia Mönchengladbach starting eleven.
Keep in mind:
A user can’t insert a player more than once.
A team can have no more than 1 Goalkeeper
The starting eleven needs to include 3 Defenders, 4 Midfielders, 3 Attackers.
The UI should reflect the user choices.
