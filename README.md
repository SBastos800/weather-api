# Weather-API
Time limit:

You have 5 hours

Required knowledge: Typescript CSS pre-processor (SCSS or SASS) Angular > v4.3 or React > v16 Bootstrap / Material Git

Duration: max 3h

Spend the time to find a clean way to solve the tasks, we just want to see how much you know about Angular/React and how you can use these awesome technologies.

The test includes 3 main challenges:

Weather API One Question Quiz Football Team Organiser

Note. Please have these challenges all in one app using routing to navigate between them.

Weather Cards

Api Doc: https://openweathermap.org/current

Api Key: 0f33f5c78acf44e7d38b5f6706f6f59d

Using the public OpenWeatherMap API, you need to build three cards displaying the current weather data for:

City of London (city_id: 2643744) City of Bristol (city_id: 4749005) Rome (city_id: 4219762)

The cards need to display: Temperature Humidity Minimum temperature at the moment Maximum temperature at the moment

Default is Kelvin, but we love Celsius so can you change the measurement please. We're interested to see some of your styling skills so please use this challenge to showcase them!

One Question Quiz Create a one question quiz that validates itself and checks the user input against the correct answer. Eg. pizza validates true when typed in an input

Football Team Organiser Using the data set provided, build a component to allow users to select players from the list and create their ideal Borussia Mönchengladbach starting eleven.#

Keep in mind: A user can’t insert a player more than once. A team can have no more than 1 Goalkeeper The starting eleven needs to include 3 Defenders, 4 Midfielders, 3 Attackers. The UI should reflect the user choices.

After you complete all the test, commit this challenge to a public GitHub repository and send us the link! Good Luck

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
